The project name for this file will be called Mjilnor, the team members involved were me and Nightinq.

It's supposed to be a 3d styled gf that can even be implemented to roblox over roblox studio.

We made it with the program solidworks. 
It was very hard, as the mates kept breaking over and over, we'd occasionally have to go back and fix it.

We're proud that we did this together, it was our very first collab with anyone and I think we nailed it >:D

We learned that teamwork i very valuable, and that we can rely on each other when we need something done.
